# JunViewer
Views Jun photos randomly, and other waifus if you wish.

#Installation
Comes with a basic eclipse project, which should be able to build it.
If that doesn't work, though, just build the java files likes normal and
make sure that the pictures are in a folder called "resources" in the
top level of the jar file when exported, as it looks in "/resources/".

#License
GPLv3. If you want to let your friends view Jun, feel free.
If you want to modify this important software, though, you must abide by
the conditions of the GPL. Not sure how the images are licensed.
